## DoggoGo in a nutshell

* This application is created for every dog owner who wants to update their skills to train their dog better and get some results effectively. Every user can create their own account and save data from their training lessons. The idea is to start with easier exercises and open new levels when user has successfully gained enough points for the next level.
* The application uses Firebase as database and for user authentication
* The repository for application [here](https://github.com/kmnHH/doggogo) on GitHub


## User interface & functionality

Here are the 4 main screens of this application.

1. **Profile screen:** Here user can view/modify her/his dog information.
2. **Home screen:** By choosing one of the image buttons, user can either learn about puppies, train her/his dog or learn about rescue dogs. (At this moment only training with dog is available)
3. **Basic skills screen:** This screen shows what kind of exercises are available for training at this moment. 
4. **Command screen:** At this moment there are 3 different command screens available. Each screen shows the instructions to train the command in question for the dog (and how many points you have at this moment).
To see the instructions, the screen is scrollable.

## Technologies & libraries

* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), JavaScript framework for mobile app development
* [Expo](https://expo.dev/), framework & platform for universal React apps
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. 



## Ideas for further development

This application is far from done, but the future implementations are still under consideration. The application contains buttons for puppies and rescue dogs, but these buttons are not yet pressable.
The future will show what kind of functionalities these will contain.


## Installation instructions for development

1. [Install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
2. [Install git](https://git-scm.com)  
3. [Install Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) on your mobile device
4. To install the app with all its associated libraries and dependencies, run the following lines in your CLI or the built-in terminal of your code editor:  

`git clone https:// github.com/kmnHH/doggogo `

`cd doggogo`

`npm install` 

`npm install â€“g expo-cli`  

`npm start`


After installation and starting the application, a browser instance with a QR code will launch on your PC. Scan the QR code with Expo Go with Android or if using iOS scan the code with your phones camera to view a local instance of the app on your phone. For the Expo Go to work, make sure your phone and your PC are on the same local network!
